# tinyTower

This is just a quick short program that lets me know what missions I am able to complete with the floors my tower has.
This requires:
  - TinyTowerMissions.csv: with a Name column and Items column (mission name and what stores needed)
  - TinyTowerFloors.csv: with Floors column (floor name)
